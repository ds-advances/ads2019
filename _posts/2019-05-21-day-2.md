  title: Artificial Intelligence for data analytics
  abstract: "A common view is that up to 80% of work on a data mining project is involved in data understanding, cleaning and preparation, yet machine learning has not focused very much on these topics.  I will describe issues around data parsing, obtaining (or inferring) a data dictionary, data integration, entity resolution, structural variability, identifying and repairing missing data, and anomaly detection and repair. I will discuss work from the AIDA project at the Alan Turing Institute which addresses some of these issues.

Joint work with Taha Ceritli, James Geddes, Zoubin Ghahramani, Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz, Ian Horrocks, Alfredo Nazabal, Tomas Petricek, Charles Sutton, and Gerrit Van Den Burg."

  title: Machine Learning for personalisation in assistive robotics
  abstract: "Assistive Robots have great potential in empowering humans with increased capabilities but for assistance to be most effective, it should be personalised to the individual. Machine learning has great potential for personalisation through the acquisition of physiological, behavioural and performance data through sensors. In this talk, I will describe our computational architectures for biologically inspired action understanding and user modelling through generative ensembles of machine learning algorithms working at multiple levels of abstraction. I will describe a range of applications demonstrating the use of data-driven personalisation in fields such as robotic wheelchairs for children, assisted dressing, robot-assisted education and human-vehicle interaction."
