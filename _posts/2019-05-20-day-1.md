  title: Language, meaning and meta-embeddings 
  abstract: "How similar is a dog to a cat? What is the relationship between a lion and a cat? It is relatively easier to explain the meanings of words using other words to a human (as many dictionaries already do), but how can we represent meanings of individual words, or relations between words in such a way that a computer can also understand? Is there only one way to represent meaning or many? These are fundamental questions that we must answer if we are to make any use of BigText collections. A method for representing the meaning must be able to generalise well across domains and languages, and ideally less influenced by our social biases. In this talk, I will first present a historical account of representation learning from textual data and then describe the state-of-the-art results in this field. Finally, I will demonstrate the limitations of our current best models for representing meanings and discuss potential future research directions"

  title: On the use and interpretation of neural attention mechanisms for biomedical natural language processing
  abstract: "Attention mechanisms allow neural networks to “focus” on particular units of input (e.g., specific words or sentences) to inform predictions. Incorporation of attention has been shown to improve model predictive performance for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Attention mechanisms also often touted (implicitly or explicitly) as affording interpretability: for a given output one can inspect the inputs to which the model assigned comparatively large attention weights.

In this talk I will discuss a few specific attentive neural architectures designed for problems in health informatics, broadly construed. Model interpretability is a key consideration in this domain; I will therefore also present empirical work that interrogates properties of attention weights to ascertain whether they afford transparency. I will discuss that while attention does consistently improve predictive performance, its use as a means of providing model interpretability is questionable."

  title: Bespoke machine learning for humanoid robots
  abstract: "We are interested in developing humanoid robots with learning capabilities. Computation and memory  are typically limited on a robot and there are often requirements of tight real-time performance. Therefore we would like to design algorithms with guaranteed computational and memory bounds. We will show that we do not need to sacrifice much in terms of performance (e.g. recognition rates, accuracy, etc.). We will show practical examples in typical robotics applications such as in the estimation of the robot’s dynamics, on the fly object learning, and speech perception. Results come in different flavors as for example in dynamics estimation the controller has to potentially learn and provide estimates in the millisecond range while longer timescales are acceptable in e.g. visual object recognition. Speech recognition, on the other hand, requires integrating voice input over time. We will show implementations in some of our humanoid robots, namely the iCub and the recently developed R1 service robot."

  title: Statistical hypothesis testing in a Bayesian non-parametric framework
  abstract: "Nonparametric statistical tests have proved themselves important tools in modern data analysis, where the emergence of large data sets can support the relaxation of linearity or normality assumptions implicit in traditional methods. In this talk, I will introduce two Bayesian nonparametric procedures for independence and two-samples testing.  Well known advantages of having an explicit probability measure include the easy comparison of evidence across different studies, the inclusion of prior information, and the integration of results within formal decision analysis. The first approach consists of a tractable, explicit and analytic quantification of the relative evidence of dependence vrs independence, using Polya tree priors on the space of probability measures which can then be embedded within a decision theoretic test for dependence.  The second approach is based on the representation of probability measures in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) via the so-called kernel mean embeddings which provide a flexible framework for fully nonparametric hypothesis testing. In practice, the performance of these RKHS tests can be very sensitive to the choice of kernel and its lengthscale parameters. To address this central issue, I will discuss  a new probabilistic model for kernel mean embeddings combining a Gaussian process prior over the RKHS containing the mean embedding with a conjugate likelihood function, thus yielding a closed form posterior over the mean embedding."
