  title: Gaussian Process Models for Low Cost Air Quality Monitoring
  abstract: "Air pollution contributes to over three million deaths each year. Kampala has one of the highest concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) of any African city. Unfortunately, with the exception of the US Embassy, there is no programme for monitoring air pollution in the city due to the high cost of the equipment required. Hence we know little about its distribution or extent. Lower cost devices do exist, but these do not, on their own, provide the accuracy required for decision makers. We propose that using a coregionalised Gaussian process to combine the low cost sensors with the embassy's high quality results provides sufficiently accurate estimates of pollution across the city."

  title: Automated quality control for sensor based symptom measurement performed outside the lab
  abstract: "The use of smartphone and wearable sensing technology for objective, non-invasive and remote clinimetric testing of symptoms has considerable potential. However, the clinimetric accuracy achievable with such technology is highly reliant on separating the useful from irrelevant or confounded sensor data. Monitoring patient symptoms using digital sensors outside of controlled, clinical lab settings creates a variety of practical challenges, such as unavoidable and unexpected user behaviours. These behaviours often violate the assumptions of clinimetric testing protocols, where these protocols are designed to probe for speciﬁc symptoms. Such violations are frequent outside the lab, and can affect the accuracy of the subsequent data analysis and scientiﬁc conclusions. At the same time, curating sensor data by hand after the collection process is inherently subjective, laborious and error-prone. To address these problems, we report on a uniﬁed algorithmic framework for automated sensor data quality control, which can identify those parts of the sensor data which are sufﬁciently reliable for further analysis. Algorithms which are special cases of this framework for different sensor data types (e.g. accelerometer, digital audio) detect the extent to which the sensor data adheres to the assumptions of the test protocol for a variety of clinimetric tests. The approach is general enough to be applied to a large set of clinimetric tests and we demonstrate its performance on walking, balance and voice smartphone-based tests, designed to monitor the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.

  title: "Leveraging Machine Learning, Citizen Science and Low Cost Sensors for Acoustic Monitoring of Ecosystems: A Case Study in Kenya"
  abstract: "Environmental degradation is a major threat facing ecosystems around the world and in order to determine ecosystems in need of conservation interventions, we must monitor the biodiversity of these ecosystems effectively. Unfortunately, traditional biodiversity monitoring methods are labour intensive and difficult to apply on a large scale. Bioacoustic approaches provide a means of surveying a large number of ecosystems by exploiting the fact that several species produce characteristic vocalizations that can be used to identify them. In this talk I will describe work aimed at exploiting advances in machine learning, citizen science, and low cost electronics for bioacoustic monitoring of bird species in Kenya. The acoustic data used in this work were obtained from a conservancy in the Mt Kenya ecosystem using low cost recorders and contains recordings from over 80 bird species. We train and test machine learning classifiers for species present within the Mt Kenya ecosystem using data collected by citizen scientists and made freely available. We show the utility of the models we train by screening the recordings from the Mt Kenya ecosystem for the presence of the Hartlaub’s Turaco (Tauraco hartlaubi), a montane species whose range is under threat from climate and land use change. We also show how the data we collect can be used to infer species distribution maps which are of great importance in conservation."

  title: Using Low-Level Interaction Data to Explore User Behaviour in Object-Based Media Experiences
  abstract: "Understanding the behaviour of users of computer-based systems through user testing is an expensive, time consuming and difficult process. However, there is the potential to non-intrusively capture the same information by collecting low-level interaction data such as mouse movements, keystrokes, and key presses. This has many potential advantages such as large sample size, remote data collection, and ecological validity. We are exploring the use of these data in the emerging new domain of “object-based media”, where pieces of media are assembled on-the-fly to enable personalised or interactive experiences. This is a challenging area for media creators as creating original content is expensive, so learning as much as possible from pilots is crucial. However, these experiences offer the chance to collect a much richer set of data about how users interact with the content and to gain insight into the behaviours they exhibit. As data can be collected and analysed in real-time, user behaviour can be interactively analysed and used to drive and adapt the experience accordingly, creating a virtuous feedback cycle. An example of this is if the user exhibits behaviour indicative of leaving the experience early then reacting to this by altering the format of the experience, e.g. condensing it, may encourage completion. We report on research that has shown that fine-grained, low-level interaction data can reveal whether a user was previewing, reviewing, or experimenting with an experience or whether they were using the experience as designed. 

This type of data presents a challenge in handling its low-level and voluminous character, which is particularly apparent when attempting to mine human interactions with software and web-based technologies. Furthermore, considering events in isolation may reveal little about user behaviour, apart from context-specific information stored contemporaneously (such as time of occurrence and event-type). Rather it is necessary to synthesise the collected data to abstract useful, semantically-meaningful behavioural characteristics. Fine-grained, low-level interaction data can be leveraged to extract various behavioural metrics, such as movement distances, speed, velocity, and more abstract metrics such as the type of scroll (fast or slow). However, to collect and store this type of data requires a large storage system and extra processing power for extraction. Higher-level interaction data, such as DOM button clicks, can be simpler to collect and result in data that is easier to work with as it has fewer and more structured features when compared to low-level events which, depending on the event-type, can have a variable number of features. In this paper, however, we demonstrate that information can be derived from low- level data that cannot be derived from higher level data, and that this information can provide insight into the user experience of object-based media."

  title: Data Science for Cyber Security
  abstract: "2017 saw the launch of the UK Industrial Strategy including Artificial Intelligence. Data Science – the effective blend of data, algorithms, analysis, and real-world problems – will be at the core of this strategy. Cyber security is also high priority for the UK government, with &pound 1.9bn invested in securing UK infrastructure, including the National Centre for Cyber Security who have a focus on active cyber defense. The harmonization of the Data Science aspects of AI with cyber security is therefore a major research challenge – one that has been adopted by Cardiff University’s Airbus Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Analytics. Launched in 2017, the Centre aims to position the UK as a leader in AI for Cyber Security, drawing on academic expertise from computer science, data science, criminology, sociology, law and politics and psychology. In this talk I will outline our perspective on cyber security analytics and how the various disciplines can contribute. I will then present some of our research on machine learning to detect and predict cyber attacks via malicious executable files – including visualization through feature maps and sequential learning of 'cyber kill chains' through recurrent neural networks. Finally I will briefly introduce a transformational research project that began in early 2018 – Chatty Factories, funded by EPSRC, aims to merge Internet of Things (IoT) technology with Operational Technology (OT) on the factory floor to create more dynamic and data-driven factories of the future while retaining security and privacy."

  title: "Analysis of Spatio-temporal Representations for Robust Footstep Recognition with Deep Residual Neural Networks"
  abstract: "Human footsteps can provide a unique behavioural pattern for robust biometric systems. We propose spatio-temporal footstep representations from floor-only sensor data in advanced computational models for automatic biometric verification. Our models deliver an artificial intelligence capable of effectively differentiating the fine-grained variability of footsteps between legitimate users (clients) and impostor users of the biometric system. The methodology is validated in the largest footstep database, containing nearly 20,000 footstep signals from more than 120 users. The database contains a large cohort of impostors and a small set of clients to verify the reliability of biometric systems. We provide experimental results in 3 critical data-driven security scenarios, according to the amount of footstep data available for model training: at airports security checkpoints (smallest training set), workspace environments (medium training set) and home environments (largest training set). With this methodology, we report state-of-the-art footstep recognition rates. "

  title: "Tensor Analysis and Learning for Multidimensional Data in Brain Imaging"
  abstract: "Machine learning is transforming medicine and healthcare with big medical data. However, many medical data, such as brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, are challenging to analyse due to their high dimensionality, multidimensional structures, but small amounts of samples available in practice. Current methods simplify such problems by time/space averaging or local/partial processing, e.g., patch-based or slice-by-slice analysis. Tensors (multidimensional arrays) can model such multidimensional data naturally with compact model sizes. We have developed tensor-based machine learning methods for extracting and/or selecting features from whole-brain fMRI data for classification and interpretation in MICCAI2015 and AAAI2017. 

We treat 3D fMRI data in their natural form, e.g., as 128x128x64 3D tensors rather than (1D) vectors of very high dimensionality (> 1 million). Our machine learning algorithms then extract and/or select features automatically from these tensors for classification and further analysis/interpretation. Some illustrations are included below. This brings the following three key benefits: 1) no information loss before machine learning; 2) compact model size or parameter space suiting better small sample size scenarios; and 3) low memory demand and better scalability. These algorithms are general machine learning tools that can be applied to any properly normalized multidimensional data. "
